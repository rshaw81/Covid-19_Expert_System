Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system â€” your nose, throat and lungs. Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it's not the same as stomach "flu" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.

For most people, the flu resolves on its own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. People at higher risk of developing flu complications include:

    Young children under age 5, and especially those under 6 months
    Adults older than age 65
    Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities
    Pregnant women and women up to two weeks after giving birth
    People with weakened immune systems
    Native Americans
    People who have chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease and diabetes
    People who are very obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher

Though the annual influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective, it's still your best defense against the flu.
